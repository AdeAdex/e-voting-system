              <h3>Overview</h3>
              This electronic voting (e-voting) system is developed to ease the
              stress of having to stand at the polling unit and also waiting for
              some days before the winner is decided.
              <p>
                This system focus on many steps or procedures that the voters
                has to take before a successful voting ✅ but before that, let
                look into this very important note.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are many different technologies that can be used to
                support the electoral process. This guide will focus on
                electronic technologies that assist voting and the subsequent
                counting of votes.
              </p>
              <p>
                When discussing electronic voting, two separate, but sometimes
                related technologies are generally referred to – electronic
                voting and electronic counting. The traditional paper-based
                voting system consists of a voter manually marking the paper
                ballot and then the ballot being counted by hand by election
                officials. In elections using electronic voting or counting
                technologies, one or both of these processes are automated
                electronically.
              </p>

              <h3>Registration Guides</h3>
              Kindly fill out the registration form and the system will look up
              your voter registration status. Remember you can't vote unless
              you've registered and you can't register if you are below the age
              of 18. Our system check properly using your National
              Identification to confirm your age and once you are eligible, you
              can then proceed with the registration. Keep in mind that any state of origin you select during the registration, thats the state you will be able to vote when it come to governorship election.
              <p>

                given a unique ID and a special key that he/she can use to
                login to the voting portal.

              you as failure to remember them maybe disqualified you from
